# Analytics events (Firebase + Meta)

Every screen and user action in the VibeLive Flutter app is sent to **Firebase Analytics** and **Meta (Facebook) App Events**. This file lists every event and what it carries. It is for anyone building reports, funnels, or ad conversions.

Code: `lib/core/analytics/` (`analytics.dart` sends events, `screen_tracker.dart` logs screens, `analytics_identity.dart` sets who the user is, `events/*.dart` holds each area's events) and `lib/app/callscreen/helper/call_analytics.dart` (calls).

## Key funnels

| funnel | events in order |
|---|---|
| Sign-in | `login` screen → `login_method_selected` → `otp_requested` → `auth_success` → `sign_up` (new account) or `login` (returning user) → `onboarding_completed` |
| Sign-in method | `sign_up` / `login` / `auth_success` carry `method` = `phone` / `email` / `google` / `apple` |
| Become a Host | `host_onboarding_started` → `host_ob_intro_viewed` → `host_ob_basic_viewed` → … → `host_ob_guidelines_completed` → `host_onboarding_submitted` (one viewed and one completed event per step, 12 steps) |
| Call (client) | `view_expert` → `call_button_tapped` → `call_initiated` → `call_ringing` → `call_accepted` → `call_started` → `call_ended`; drop-offs: `call_initiate_failed`, `call_cancelled`, `call_not_answered`, `call_rejected`, `call_failed` |
| Call (host) | `call_incoming` → `call_accepted` → `call_started` → `call_ended`; drop-offs: `call_declined`, `call_missed`, `call_failed` |
| Top-up | `wallet_opened` → `add_money_opened` → `add_money_amount_selected` → `initiate_payment` → `payment_success` (or `payment_failed` / `payment_abandoned`) |

## Meta conversion events (for ad optimization)

| Meta event | sent when |
|---|---|
| `fb_mobile_complete_registration` | a new account is created (once per user) |
| `fb_mobile_content_view` | a host profile is opened (value = per-minute rate) |
| `fb_mobile_search` | a search returns results |
| `fb_mobile_add_to_wishlist` | a host is added to favourites |
| `fb_mobile_initiated_checkout`, `fb_mobile_add_payment_info` | a top-up or badge payment starts; `fb_mobile_initiated_checkout` also when a call is booked (`content_type: call_booking`) |
| Purchase (`logPurchase`, INR) | a top-up or badge payment succeeds (once per transaction) |
| `fb_mobile_rate` | a call is rated or reviewed |
| `SubmitApplication` | a host application is submitted |
| `fb_mobile_tutorial_completion` | the intro slides are finished |
| `Contact` | support is contacted |
| custom: `first_call_completed`, `first_topup`, `expert_signup`, `call_started`, `call_ended`, … | every custom event below also reaches Meta under the same name |


## How tracking works

- Every event goes to **both** Firebase Analytics and Meta (Facebook) App Events through one class, `Analytics` (`lib/core/analytics/analytics.dart`). Where a Meta standard event or a Firebase recommended event exists, it is sent as well (noted in the tables).
- Event names reuse the RN app's names wherever RN had one (`sign_up`, `login`, `view_expert`, `call_started`, `payment_success`, …). Both apps share the same Firebase project and Meta app, so reports continue across the update.
- No personal data goes into event parameters: no phone numbers, emails, client names, OTPs, or typed text. Ids, counts, and booleans only. The user's email, phone, name, gender, and date of birth go to Meta only through **advanced matching** (`setUserData`), which the SDK hashes on the device.
- Automatic events: Firebase logs `first_open`, `session_start`, `user_engagement`, `app_update` on its own. Meta logs install, app launch, and sessions on its own (auto-logging is on).

## Screens (`screen_view`)

Every page, Home tab, onboarding step, sheet, and dialog sends a screen view. It goes to Firebase as its native `screen_view` and to Meta as a custom `screen_view` event with `screen_name`. Code: `lib/core/analytics/screen_tracker.dart`.

| screen_name | what |
|---|---|
| splash | splash / intro |
| login | sign-in options (sub-views: login_mobile, login_email, login_otp_mobile, login_otp_email, login_phone_required) |
| onboarding_age_gate, onboarding_language | 18+ gate, language pick |
| home_discover, home_history, home_me | the three Home tabs |
| search | search |
| call, incoming_call | call screen, incoming ring |
| wallet | wallet |
| personal_info, gst_details, favourites, blocked_users, referral | Me sub-pages |
| categories, category_menu, dynamic_page (slug), about_app, support, webview (url) | resources / CMS |
| host_onboarding (+ host_onboarding_<step> per step) | Become a Host |
| host_profile_edit, host_expertise, host_schedule, host_call_rates | host edits a section |
| host_approval_status, host_profile_qr | host hub |
| verification_badge, verification_badge_form, verification_badge_fee, verification_badge_status | blue-tick badge |
| `*_sheet` | every bottom sheet / dialog (names in each area's table) |
| route_<path> | any route added later that has no name yet |

## User identity (`lib/core/analytics/analytics_identity.dart`)

On sign-in, profile change, and sign-out:

- **User id** (documentId) on Firebase (`setUserId`) and Meta (`setUserID`).
- **Firebase user properties:** `user_role` (client / host), `host_approved`, `is_company`, `gender`, `app_language`.
- **Meta advanced matching:** email, phone (91…), first name, gender (m/f), date of birth (YYYYMMDD), country `in`, and `externalId` = user id.
- `logout` {reason: user | session_expired}, then the ids are cleared on both platforms.

## Calls (`lib/app/callscreen/helper/call_analytics.dart`)

Every call event comes from one observer on the call's state, so calls answered from CallKit, a push, the Android notification, or the app are all counted the same way.

Common params on every call event: `call_id`, `call_type` (audio | video), `role` (caller | receiver), `host_id` and `expert_id` (the same value, caller side; `expert_id` is RN's name), `peer_id`, `category`, `instant_call`, `company_call`.

| event | when | extra params |
|---|---|---|
| call_initiated | caller: the call was created on the server, ringing starts | |
| book_consultation | caller: the server accepted the call (not busy), once per call (RN name); with Meta `fb_mobile_initiated_checkout` {content_id, content_type: call_booking, category, currency} | expert_id, category |
| call_incoming | receiver: the ring is shown | locked, auto_accept |
| call_ringing | caller: the host's phone is ringing | |
| call_accepted | the call was answered (both sides) | ring_seconds |
| call_started | connected, the timer is running (RN name) | rate_per_min |
| call_ended | a connected call finished (RN name); Meta value = duration in seconds | end_reason, duration_seconds, duration_minutes, duration_bucket (under_1m, 1_5m, 5_15m, 15_30m, over_30m), rate_per_min |
| call_cancelled | caller hung up before an answer | end_reason, ring_seconds |
| call_not_answered | caller: nobody answered in time | end_reason, ring_seconds |
| call_rejected | caller: the host declined / the server ended it before connect | end_reason, ring_seconds |
| call_declined | receiver declined (in the app, on CallKit, or decline + block / report) | end_reason, ring_seconds, source |
| call_missed | receiver never answered (caller cancelled, ring timed out, answered on another device) | end_reason, ring_seconds |
| call_failed | could not connect (join failed, the other side never joined, network) | end_reason, ring_seconds, was_accepted |
| first_call_started / first_call_completed | the user's first call as a caller (once per user, per install) | as call_started / call_ended |
| host_first_call_started / host_first_call_completed | a host's first received call | as above |

`end_reason` values: user_hangup, remote_hangup, remote_dropped, remote_ended, admin_ended, balance_exhausted, network_lost, token_expired, no_answer, peer_never_joined, join_failed, other_device, answered_elsewhere, system_ui, declined, caller_cancelled, ring_timeout, safety_block, safety_report, sign_out.

## Sign-in, onboarding, intro, push and deep links

client/favourites/helper/favourites_actions.dart (could pass `callback`, `history`, `favourites`).

## Host: onboarding funnel, hub, badge, availability

Helpers: `lib/core/analytics/events/host_events.dart` (`HostEvents`). Funnel tracker: `lib/app/hosthub/onboarding/helper/host_funnel.dart` (`HostFunnel`).
Common params: `mode` = `new` | `resume` | `edit` | `existing_host`; `source` = `become_host` | `host_hub` | `deeplink` | `?source=` query value; `step` = HostStep name; `step_number` = 1..12.

### "Become a Host" funnel (one event name per step → funnels in Firebase AND Meta)
Steps in order: intro(1), basic(2), interests(3), photos(4), voice(5), tagline(6), bio(7), rates(8), availability(9), preview(10), guidelines(11), submitted(12).

## Payments and wallet

### Payments (wallet, top-up, checkout, offers, transfer, payout account)

Helpers: `lib/core/analytics/events/payment_events.dart` (`PaymentEvents`). All events go to Firebase + Meta unless marked.
RN names kept: `wallet_opened`, `initiate_payment`, `payment_success`, `payment_failed`, `payment_abandoned`,

Not applicable: the Add Money screen has no free-typed custom amount (cards only), so there is no "custom amount / invalid amount" event; Razorpay's success payload carries no method, so `payment_method` stays the gateway (`razorpay`/`payu`), as in RN.

#### Sheets / dialogs named (screen views)
`add_money_sheet`, `payment_status_dialog` (also used by the verification-badge fee), `transfer_sheet`, `bank_sheet`,
`first_topup_offer_sheet`, `abandon_offer_sheet`, `balance_gate_sheet`; in-page view `web_checkout` {kind}.
